         friend: Nice hike so far!
         friend 2, 3 and you: Yeah!
         you: I'm a little thirsty though.
         friend: Well met! Go drink some water! We'll be waiting here.
         *you go to the nearest food stand and get some water, which is, inconveniently, green cactus juice.*
         You suddenly can't find your friends, but grow more thirsty and thirsty, forcing you to find water.
         *send to water minigame*

         *once done with cactus maze minigame*
         You sleep, and wake up to another day of drinking water, but suddenly cacti come chasing after you!
         *send to cacti chase minigame*
         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         *once done with cacti chase minigame*
         The cacti catch up to you!!! But... they aren't cacti, they're your friends! And they're tired?
         friend 1, 2, 3: Stop running!!!!!
         you: Huh?
         friend 1: We were all worried sick about you! One second you need to grab a drink, and another second we can't find you for a whole night!
         you: But I thought I lost you guys?
         friend 1: nu-uh!
         friend 1: First you went around in circles like crazy *you thinking of the water minigame*
         friend 1: Second then you dissapeared for like, a WHOLE NIGHT! *you thinking of the cactus maze*
         friend 1: Luckily in the morning we found you and it lead to this. *you thinking of the cactus chase*
         you: ...huh *thinking of the oddly green water you drank from the food stand*
         friend 1: Wait... Have you been drinking that cactus juice again?
         you: *thinking of it again*
         you: ...
         friend 1: Well at least we have you back!
         *cutscenes of the fun that you had after that*
         you: hope to see you all again! *breaking 4th wall* bye!
         *finish game*
