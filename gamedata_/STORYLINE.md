RUN, SCREAM, HIDE, GET AWAY FROM THE CACTUS!" then, your friends respond: "why do you think there is cactus chasing you?", and you respond "THEY WERE JUST CHASING ME!". At that moment, your friends glance at each other and say: "have you been drinking that cactus juice?", then you, hiding behind a rock, respond: "no, why?" while thinking of the green juice you drank earlier. Then you friend say: "come on, let's just continue the hike." and you realize that you have been drinking cactus juice."
