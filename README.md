## About the Game

A Fun Hike is a story-driven adventure game about a fun day out that takes an unexpected turn! Now you're alone, lost, and the sun is setting.

This isn't just about walking, though. You have to survive and find your friends!

## Key Features

* Survival Mechanics: Keep an eye on your water level! If you don't find water sources and take a drink, you won't make it to nightfall.
* The Light: As the sun disappears, you'll see a small, flickering light in the distance—the campfire your friends are waiting at. You must use all your skill to navigate the darkness and move toward that light.
* The story is just beginning what happens next is packed full of surprises...
